**YES! The commands start BOTH the bot AND dashboard together.**

## **Here's what to do:**

### **1. Start everything:**
```bash
bot-start
```

You'll see output like:
```
✅ Bot LIVE
✅ Dashboard LIVE
```

### **2. That's it! Just close MobaXterm**

Since both are running with `nohup` and `&`, they're **detached** from your terminal session. They'll keep running 24/7 even after you:
- ✅ Close MobaXterm
- ✅ Turn off your computer
- ✅ Disconnect from internet

---

## **When you come back later:**

### **Open MobaXterm and check status:**
```bash
bot-status
```

### **View logs:**
```bash
bot-logs     # Press Ctrl+C to exit
dash-logs    # Press Ctrl+C to exit
```

### **Stop everything:**
```bash
bot-stop
```

### **Restart everything:**
```bash
bot-restart
```

## **Quick Summary:**

1. Run `bot-start`
2. Wait for "✅ Bot LIVE" and "✅ Dashboard LIVE"
3. **Just close MobaXterm** - done!

Your bot and dashboard are now running 24/7 in the background. You don't need to press anything special or keep the terminal open.

**Access your dashboard anytime at:** `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:8080`
